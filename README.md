## Currently supported fixes
1. Fix the issue that prevents the game from being played due to maintenance of the Chinese skin library.
2. Migrate the Chinese skin library.
3. Fix the issue where dragons sometimes turn into humans after logging into the game.
4. Fix the issue where downgrading dragon skills can be used to farm experience.

**Tip:**
You can enable or disable any of the above individual fixes in the configuration file. 
The configurations for the client and server are separate, and by default, all fixes are enabled. 
These fixes are merely temporary solutions to errors, and the changes made to address the errors may not represent the final decisions for Dragon Survival (for example, adjustments to the downgrade skill functionality logic).
Please disable the corresponding fix of this MOD promptly after DS releases a new fix update.
