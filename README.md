# DragonSurvivalFix
This is an emergency patch mod for the DragonSurvival module, created to fix serious errors in DragonSurvival.
- About the DragonSurvival module: https://github.com/DragonSurvivalTeam/DragonSurvival

## Currently supported fixes
1. Fix the issue that prevents the game from being played due to maintenance of the Chinese skin library.
2. Migrate the Chinese skin library.
3. Fix the issue where dragons sometimes turn into humans after logging into the game.
4. Fix the issue where downgrading dragon skills can be used to farm experience.

**Tip:**
You can enable or disable any of the above individual fixes in the configuration file. The configurations for the client and server are separate, and by default, all fixes are enabled. These fixes only provide the functionality of the fixes themselves and may not result in behavior identical to the DS fixes after application (for example, adjustments to the downgraded skill functionality).
